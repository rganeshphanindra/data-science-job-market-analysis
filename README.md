# Decoding the Data Science Job Market

## Context
Data science roles are often described as broad, ambiguous, and inconsistent across companies. Job titles, required skills, and salary expectations vary widely, making it difficult for candidates and organizations to understand what “data science” actually means in practice. Analyzing job posting data provides a grounded way to study how data-related roles are defined, valued, and compensated across the market.

## Project Objective
This project analyzes data science job postings to understand **how roles are structured, which skills are most in demand, and how compensation varies across positions and locations**. The goal is to move beyond anecdotal career advice and use data to identify concrete patterns in hiring expectations and salary trends.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of publicly available job postings and includes information such as:
- Job titles and role categories
- Required skills and technologies
- Company details and locations
- Salary estimates and compensation ranges

The dataset is included in the `data/` directory to ensure reproducibility.

## Key Questions Explored
- How are data science roles distributed across different job titles and companies?
- Which skills and tools appear most frequently in job postings?
- How do salaries vary by role, experience level, and location?
- What patterns emerge in compensation across different segments of the job market?

## Key Findings
- Data science roles vary significantly in both required skill sets and compensation, even when job titles appear similar.
- Technical depth and role specialization are strongly associated with higher salary ranges.
- Location plays a meaningful role in compensation, with certain regions consistently offering higher salary potential.
- The job market reflects a wide spectrum of “data science” positions, ranging from analytics-focused roles to more engineering- and modeling-heavy positions.

## Scope and Limitations
This project focuses on exploratory and descriptive analytics. Findings represent patterns and associations observed in job postings and do not imply causality or guarantee individual hiring outcomes.
